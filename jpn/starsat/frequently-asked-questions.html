                <h2 class="beta">Getting Started</h2>

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">Do you need a new decoder?</h3>
                <p>StarSat will have a new HD decoder. Current or former TopTV subscribers can use their TopTV decoder to receive the StarSat signal. Or, if they prefer, they can buy the new StarSat HD decoder and use it together with their current TopTV satellite dish installation. The cost of the StarSat HD decoder ONLY (i.e. without dish and installation) is a reduced price.</p>

                <h2 class="beta">Channels &amp; Shows</h2>

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">Does StarSat have HD channels?</h3>
                <p>StarSat does not offer HD channels at present. However, the decoder is fully HD compliant and ready to receive HD channels as soon as StarSat brings these into the packages.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">What channels and programmes does StarSat offer?</h3>
                <p>StarSat offers content in the following main genres: movies, series, drama, news, knowledge, family, sport, kids, music and cultural programming, among other genres.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">What makes StarSat&rsquo;s offering different from its competitors?</h3>
                <p>The key difference is that StarSat will offer its subscribers choice in their TV viewing at an affordable price. Through packages that are streamlined to suit their pockets and viewing preferences.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">What channels are available on StarSat?</h3>
                <p>StarSat is home to some of the world&rsquo;s most popular channels, including Fox, MGM and Discovery. There are also the StarSat &lsquo;own&rsquo; channels, which are packaged specifically for StarSat subscribers.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">Can subscribers expect the same channels as on DStv?</h3>
                <p>No, but StarSat will be offering subscribers similar genres of programmes.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">Will StarSat be commissioning programming?</h3>
                <p>While StarSat will acquire local content, StarSat is currently not commissioning local content. This may change, depending on future strategies.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">How does StarSat decide on which genres to offer its customers?</h3>
                <p>The packages and channel genres are compiled based on the results of market research which shows the trends in viewing choices among viewers. Based on these findings, StarSat has given our customers the option of choice. These trends will be constantly monitored to ensure that there is a genre available to suit all tastes.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">How did StarSat decide on what content goes into the different packages?</h3>
                <p>StarSat aims to provide viewers who take the StarSat Special package with a good variety of channels, to give them value at a very affordable price. Some of the channels and programmes in the premium packages are sold internationally, as premium content, and are more expensive for StarSat to acquire, thus they are available in the Sensation and Superior packages, but still offer very good value for money.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">What research did you conduct to help your decision?</h3>
                <p>StarSat conducts various research projects amongst its subscribers and target market on a regular basis. The methodology of the research is selected based on the specific objectives at the time.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">How do commercials/advertisements fit in?</h3>
                <p>StarSat will be re&ndash;introducing local commercials/advertisements soon. When we do, we will comply with the regulations governing the number of minutes per hour which can be allocated to advertising. For some of the 3rd party channels there are existing advertisements that are not relevant to South Africa. In time these will be replaced by local advertisements.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">Why does StarSat not show sporting events that the customer is interested in, like soccer, rugby, etc?</h3>
                <p>StarSat will continue to strive to get the rights to relevant sporting event. However we are unable to broadcast these while other platforms have exclusive rights.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">Why doesn&rsquo;t StarSat show some of the channels that are on DStv?</h3>
                <p>DStv has exclusive arrangements with those distributors. StarSat will continuously endeavour to get these channels when DStv&rsquo;s contract period is up (sometimes up to 3 years). We can however recommend programmes and channels on StarSat that are similar in genre to the programmes on DStv.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">What sports channels do you offer?</h3>
                <p>Setanta Africa, Setanta Action, Eurosport News, Fuel and NBA TV and, of course, sport broadcast on SABC1, 2, 3 or eTV.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">Where can we get an updated schedule and synopsis of programmes?</h3>
                <p>The best place to find updated information on the TV programme schedules is on the EPG (Electronic Programme Guide). You can also mark your favourite programmes for viewing later.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">How often are the channel schedules updated?</h3>
                <p>The programme schedules are available on the website, and are available for up to 7 days ahead. Other changes are updated as soon as new information becomes available.</p>
                <p>Third party channels (that is, mainly international channels) normally give us the schedules about 45 days before the month begins. These are then incorporated into our EPG system.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">Why does StarSat repeat programmes?</h3>
                <p>This is the practice for any pay TV service. Some of the programming is re-run for the convenience of our audience as we know that not everyone is able to catch their favourite shows at the time that we first schedule them.</p>

Any changes to date of debit order must be made 7 working days before the 20th of that month.

                <h2 class="beta">Installation</h2>

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">Where can I buy a StarSat decoder?</h3>
                <p>You can SMS &ldquo;STAR&rdquo; to 40004 and an agent will call you back. Or call 086 086 STAR/7827 directly.</p>
                <p>We are currently updating our list of retail outlets and this will be posted onto the website shortly.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">What hardware equipment do I need to get StarSat?</h3>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>At least an 80cm Satellite Dish and Low Noise Block down Converter (LNB)</li>
                    <li>A StarSat HD decoder</li>
                    <li>A Smart Card, which will come with your decoder</li>
                    <li>An LNB Cable that is connected to the dish and decoder</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">I already have a DStv/MultiChoice/MNet decoder and satellite dish &ndash; can&rsquo;t I use this?</h3>
                <p>A StarSat satellite dish faces in an approximate north&ndash;west direction as the satellite&rsquo;s orbital position is at 5 degrees east. This position is north-west, relative from South Africa. A DStv dish faces north&ndash;east as the DStv satellite is positioned at 68 degrees east, this is east relative from South Africa. Because the satellites are positioned at totally different positions, you cannot access information from both providers with the same satellite dish.</p>
                <p>Due to signal piracy (i.e. people who do not subscribe to pay television but sometimes &lsquo;hack&rsquo; into the transmission and receive services for free!), broadcasters have resorted to encrypting their signals. The decoder (STB) and smart card are designed specifically to the broadcaster&rsquo;s encryption specifications to unscramble the transmission and bring you your favourite programmes. Thus, because StarSat decoders receive a signal that is encrypted differently to that of a DStv signal it cannot be used to view DStv programming and vice versa.</p>
                <p>Your DStv satellite dish is 60cm in radius. StarSat prescribes a minimum dish radius of 80cm. You can use your existing dish, but we strongly advise that you do not, as we cannot guarantee the quality of the StarSat signal you receive.</p>
                <!-- // Question -->

                <h3 class="gamma orange tf-uppercase">What does a &lsquo;standard installation&rsquo; mean?</h3>
                <p>A standard installation consists of the installation of the satellite dish and connection of your decoder for you to receive your services, using a maximum 25 meter LNB cable (cable that connects your satellite dish to your decoder). This installation is done directly to your television and the installer will ensure that all settings are correct and in working order before he leaves.</p>
                <p>The installation includes your satellite dish, however, a standard bracket is used. If your building requires a special bracket, your installer will advise you of the additional cost thereof.</p>
                <p>If you require anything over and above this, e.g. connecting your home theatre system, then the installer will provide you with a quote and you should make installation and payment arrangements for this additional service.</p>
